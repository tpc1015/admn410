  <h2 class="center">Durham House of Pets</h2>
	<p class="center large">Back in 1989, Sam Clancey opened a pet store and named it after his home town of Durham. The pet store offered puppies and kittens to local customers as well as exotic fish. Three decades later it is still a small family owned business deeply rooted in the coastal New Hampshire community. When most local residents think of where to find their new family pet, Durham House of Pets is one of their first choices. Many of our returning customers grew up enjoying visits, looking for puppies, kittens or a new fish for the aquarium. Sometimes they may just come and relax in the family atmostphere of the coasts favorite pet store. Today, we still encourage that family feeling in each of our three New Hampshire locations. Some of our customer come from as far away as Boston, Portland and Concord to take advantage of the highest quality and selection. We strive to make each experience the best it can be. </p>
